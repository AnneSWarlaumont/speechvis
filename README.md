# speechvis

This project provides a set of tools for segmenting, analyzing, and visualizing recorded speech. In particular, the goal
is to treat segmented speech from the Buckeye speech corpus or Warlaumont IVFCR corpus as high-dimensional time-series,
and provide an analytic library to reveal the structure within these high-dimensional data.
